            Everyone who knows me to an extent is usually familiar with my favorite
            dog breed: the golden retriever. I could talk about this breed for hours,
            despite the unfortunate fact of never owning one (because, well parents).
            Just look at the pictures below, how could you ever say no to that face?
            <img src = "golden.jpeg" float: right width = "50" height = "50" />
        </p>
        
        <p style = "font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">
            <img src = "goldenpuppies.jpeg" float: left width = "50" height = "50" />
            Allow me to tell you a bit about what makes golden retrievers the best dog
            breed to exist. For one, they are one of the most gentle and compassionate
            breeds. Man's best friend, for real. Because of their temperament, their
            desire to always please their owners makes them easy to train and very
            obedient pups when well-trained. In short, golden retrievers are known as
            the best family dog.
